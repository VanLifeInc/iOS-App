# iOS-App
This repo will eventually contain the iOS implementation of our app. Currently, I am going through the iOS app tutorial found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1). Once I am done this tutorial I will comment the tutorial code in much more detail, combining information from the tutorial as wel as clarifications from my own research. After this, I will start work on the app in earnest, focusing on the UI first before the netcode.
